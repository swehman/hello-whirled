Organized minutia

I am a freelance writer interested in collaborating with digital asset projects. My goal is to bring a greater clarity and ease of understanding for non-technical users of cryptocurrencies, tokens and related platforms or products. 

Proofreading, editing and generating marketing copywriting are my key interests.

Noob-proofing your materials and processes will be absolutely essential if you want to acheive mainstream adoption. I'm here to help realize that goal.
